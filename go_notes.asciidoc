Packages, Variables and Functions
---------------------------------

Packages
~~~~~~~~

* Every Go program is made up of packages.
  Programs start running in package main.
* By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path
* imports can be grouped into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.
  This is preferred over individual imports.
