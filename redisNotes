What is redis
--------------

* In memory database.
* Key-value store

The important takeaways from this chapter are:
* Keys are strings which identify pieces of data (values)
* Values are arbitrary byte arrays that Redis doesnâ€™t care about
* Redis exposes (and is implemented as) five specialized data structures
* Combined, the above make Redis fast and easy to use, but not suitable for every scenario

Database
---------

The biggest level of compartmentalization

#default database is 0.
select 0


Setting
--------

set users:leto '{"name": "leto", "planet": "dune", "likes": ["spice"]}'
