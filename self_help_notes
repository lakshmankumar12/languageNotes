Getting Things Done
-------------------

* The GTD workflow consists of five stages: capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage
  * capture
     Stuff is anything that calls for attention. It could be preparing for our
     interview with our dream-company or reading about the sofa we saw in the
     ad in a weekly magazine. We dont prioritize one or the other. Its just
     stuff. We just capture all the stuff.
  * Clarify
     We take out stuff from the capturing-place into its appropriate location.
     * Decide what to do with each item - ignore(!), just file it for reference 
       or to do something about it - some-day maybe or to-act-on
     * List down the action-steps. Is the next step for me or to wait on someone
  * Organize
     It is to move it in its right bucket.
  * Reflect
     Keep checking on your action buckets to ensure the items are in the right place
     and your action lists are live!
  * Engage
     Do what is to be done in this moment, with undivided attention.

The Practising Mind
--------------------

* Have self-discipline, stay focused and be completely present while enjoying
  the process.
* Avoid instant-gratification and dis-empowering questions like: Can I ever
  ever achieve this goal? It this really meant to be?
* We should be aware of how we are doing and continually make efforts to
  improve and get closer towards our goals.
* Be non-judgemental
